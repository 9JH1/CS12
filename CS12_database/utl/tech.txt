USE ADVANCED TECHNIQUES TO DEVELOP A DATABASE:
- designing the structure of data -> lib/data.h 
- using appropriate tools and advanced techniques
  to organise, query and present data for a purpose
  and end users
	-> to organize     : yes
	-> to query        : yes
	-> to present data : yes

- Applying appropriate data integrity and 
  testing procedures 
	-> has been tested
	-> data integrity held using git version control 

- explaining relevant implications: yes

USE ADVANCED TECHNIQUES TO DEVELOP AN INFORMED DATABASE:
- use ionformation from testing procedures to 
  improve the quality of the database -> yes

- structuring, organizing and querying the data logically
  -> structuring : yes
	-> organizing  : yes
	-> querying    : yes

USE ADVANED TECHNIQUES TO DEVELOP A REFINED DATABASE:
- iterative improvement throughout the design, 
  development and testing process
	-> iterative improvement : yes

- presenting the data effectivly for purpose and 
  end use : no

IMPLICATIONS USED:
- social                              : no 
- cultural                            : no
- legal                               : yes
  -> security is maintained 

- ethical                             : yes
  -> security is maintained 

- intellectual property               : yes
  -> the database is written from scratch which negates this 
	   issue, others may use access which may involve legal 
		 concern 

- privacy                             : yes
  -> data is secured.

- acessibility                        : yes
  -> linked to usability 

- usability                           : yes
  -> database has concise and easy to read ui statements 

- functionality                       : yes
  -> code works as described 

- aesthetics                          : yes
  -> ui has been iteratively developed.

- sustainability and furture proofing : yes
  -> database uses static dependancies which 
	   maintains this.

- end-user considerations             : yes
  -> was made for a theoretical client

- heath and safety                    : yes

ADVANCED TECHNIQUES USED:
- linking data in related tables or nodes using queries or keys
  -> used id keys to link data between structured tables.

- writing custom queries to filder and/or sort data 
  -> a custom column sort function is used to get 
	   the book genre data, also when printing any report
		 the symbolic metadata part is all queryed data using 
		 the custom id keys mentioned previously.
	
- using logical mathmatical and/or wildcard operators:
	-> because my database is using a NoSQL based system
		 there is no way to do querys like so.

- customizing the persentation of data 
  -> the ui code is hand written from scratch and has been 
	   highly customized, as I am making a TUI, not a UI using 
		 microsoft access or another software, I have full control 
		 and responsibility over how my project looks, at one point 
		 the ui was not very appealing but was later changed after 
		 feedback was given.

- Using custom forms to add user input to the database 
  -> forms are available off of the databases main menu.

- setting validation rules for data entry 
  -> forms have a few bound condition checks to ensure that 
	   data is entered correctly.
