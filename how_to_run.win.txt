in order to run this program you need a compiler, for windows i would recommend tdm-GCC,
to install tdm-GCC go to https://jmeubank.github.io/tdm-gcc/download/ and download the
tdm-gcc-webdl.exe file, run this file and go through setup options to install tdm-GCC, 
after install you should be able to run the following command to compile the database:

gcc -o out main.c lib/*.c -g -O2  

after this run the following:

./out.exe --run

use the arrow up/down keys to navigate menus.
