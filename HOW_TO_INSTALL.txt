To install in windows you need to install a compiler, I recommend twm-gcc but if you want to use another compiler 
just make sure it provides the gcc command globally, heres how to install twm-gcc if you need too:

go to "https://jmeubank.github.io/tdm-gcc/download/" and download tdm64-gcc (not tdm-gcc or tdm-gcc-webdl)
now open the installer and go through the setup.


now that you have installed GCC you can now compile the file, download all of this code locally this can be done 
by opening "https://github.com/9JH1/CS12/archive/refs/heads/main.zip" in your browser, this will download a zip 
of all the code, unzip this and open that folder in cmd or powershell and execute: 

gcc -o main main.c main_lib.c 

A new file should have appeared ( main.exe ) run this file to execute the program.
if any issues occured either google it or email me.
