To install in windows you need to install a compiler, I recommend twm-gcc but if you want to use another compiler 
just make sure it provides the gcc command globally, heres how to install twm-gcc if you need too:

go to https://jmeubank.github.io/tdm-gcc/download/ and download tdm64-gcc (not tdm-gcc or tdm-gcc-webdl)
now open the installer and go through the setup.

now to compile the file, download all of this code locally, open the folder in cmd or powershell and execute: 

gcc -o main main.c main_lib.c 

A new file should have appeared ( main.exe ) run this file to execute the program.
if any issues occured either google it or email me.
