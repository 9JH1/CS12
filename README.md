---------------------------------------
main.c is the file you want to view it 
contains the clean and short code, if 
you want to make your job harder you 
can go ahead and view main_lib.c and 
main_lib.h which contain garbage code 
and definitions which don't really 
make any difference to the main.c code 

!!! IMPORTANT !!! 
---------------------------------------
TO COMPILE THE CODE ON WINDOWS PLEASE 
VIEW THE HOW_TO_INSTALL.txt FILE. 

if you want to compile for a unix based
system clone the code locally and run 
gcc -o main main.c main_lib.c 
---------------------------------------

Goodluck.
