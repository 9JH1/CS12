## Year 12 Database Assessment
```
---------------------------------------
main.c contains all of the proof-read 
and pretty code, lib.c contains all of
the excess code that DOES NOT look good 

Ive done it this way so that you can  
easily read the code without having to 
actually look up all of the definitions. 
there are single line function calls at 
the start of the main.c file next to 
this is a comment showing what the 
function does. I hope this is simple 
enough.

!!! IMPORTANT !!! 
---------------------------------------
TO COMPILE THE CODE ON WINDOWS PLEASE 
VIEW THE HOW_TO_INSTALL.txt FILE. 

if you want to compile for a unix based
system clone the code locally and run 
gcc -o main main.c main_lib.c

## Year 12 Programming Assessment:
```
---------------------------------------
main.c is the file you want to view it 
contains the clean and short code, if 
you want to make your job harder you 
can go ahead and view main_lib.c and 
main_lib.h which contain garbage code 
and definitions which don't really 
make any difference to the main.c code

Goodluck.
