## CS12_program
This project is a Basic burrito ordering system, when run the user is prompted with several options for example; Enter Order, Management Summary, Kitchen Screen Exit, Credits & Help. these options allow the user to interact with a local database containing order information. This database is a DMA'd (Dynamic memory allocation) array of orders. This project received the highest grade possible.
Some skills used in this project are as follows:
- Advanced understanding of C types (stucts, enums)
- Modular code (using functions and librarys)
- Header use (using librarys)
- User Input loop
- Terminal UI
- Ansi styling (colors and font changes eg italic, bold)
- Signal hander (the program knows when the user trys to close it)
- Documentation (code in main.c is documented using docstrings and absurd amounts of commenting)
- Memory understanding (memory is allocated and de-allocated correctly)
Remeber this code was made for a teacher to look over, this is why nearly every semi-intermediate skill and above is commented throughly.

## CS12_database 
This project uses the fread and fwrite functions to read and write a dynamically allocated array of a libraries staff members, books, authors, book loans, book payments and other members. This program has a very barebones interface for interacting with data:
```
select option
  1. full report
  2. individual report
  3. count books by genre
  4. return a book        <
```
the user can use the arrow keys to move to items on this menu. the options do different things for example full report lists ALL information throughout the database, individual report lets you view the information from either a member or a book and the other two options where assessment deliverables.
This project is still under moderation but as far as I know I am the only person from my class that wrote an actual database from scratch all of them ended up using another tool like MS Access.
